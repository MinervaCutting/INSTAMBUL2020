<h2><strong>DESTINATION: ISTANBUL</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Here’s a little about Istanbul</strong> The city of <strong>Istanbul</strong> is full of history and culture and is developing very quickly, offering an amazing mix of past and present architecture and places. In the meantime It is very easy to access either the Bosphorus river that separates Europe and Asia or Sultanahmet area with all its <strong>magnificent monuments (the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sofia…)</strong> Turkey and especially Istanbul, is <strong>very accessible</strong> from all around the world thanks to the increasing development of Turkish Airlines and other airline companies that fly to our <strong>2 international airports</strong>. We are also located very close to <strong>Taksim square (4 Km)</strong> which is the main area for culture, shopping and restaurants/bars. The New İstanbul Airport is located 35 kilometers north of the city center (Taksim Square), by the <strong>shores of the Black Sea</strong>. The İstanbul Airport was built as the largest in the world with over 150 million annual passenger capacity in its last planned expansion stage, whilst having the potential to handle 200 million annual passengers if required in the future. There are many taxis, shuttle bus service to the city center, and a light railway (metro) to the city will be completed by 2020. Enclosed you may also see the Turkish Airlines Meeting Products Presentation which includes THY World Map and benefits for the meetings planners who books their event in Turkey.
